# Simple-Python-Folder-Loop-Script-and-CSV-creation
Write a python script that:
1. Loops though a directory (1 level deep) and not recursive.
2. In each directory check if there is a file inside it.
3. Check if the file contains any text inside.
4. Check if it contains a specific list of keywords.



Create a csv file that does some very simple logic eg: is a specific "keyword" in text. Details will be provided.
